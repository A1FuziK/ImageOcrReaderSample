Primitive OCR solution. For demonstration :) .
Use a simple custom bp neural net with linear arctivation function - and primitive custom functions to locate the content on the image.

The demo trains only with a single character set.

Needs OpenCV (for image loading, saving)!

Have fun! & Happy coding!
